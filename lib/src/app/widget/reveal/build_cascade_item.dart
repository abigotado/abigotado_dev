/// pubspec code body — so it fades and slides in during its `RevealBuild`
/// cascade phase, staggered by [index] of [count] total items.
///
/// Like `TypeOnHeading`, the animated behavior is entirely opt-in via
/// [SectionBuildScope.maybeOf]: a caller outside any `RevealBuild` (or under
/// one in lite mode, or in this CONTRACTS pass where `RevealBuild` never
/// provides a scope) gets [child] back completely unchanged.
///
/// ## Static branch (`SectionBuildScope.maybeOf` returns `null`)
///
/// Returns [child] verbatim — no `Opacity`, no `FractionalTranslation`, not
/// even an extra layout box. This keeps the wrapped content's layout/paint
/// output byte-identical to not being wrapped at all, which is exactly what
/// lets the section goldens stay pinned through this pass.
///
/// ## Animated branch (`SectionBuildScope.maybeOf` returns non-`null`)
///
/// Delegates to [_AnimatedCascadeItem] — see its doc for the intended
/// green-pass render. Unreachable in the CONTRACTS pass for the same reason
/// as `TypeOnHeading`'s animated branch.
